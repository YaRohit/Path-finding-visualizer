# Path-finding-visualizer
This is a simple web-based application that visualises the alogithms path-finding algorithm visualizer.



We have used simple technologies like:-

HTML.

CSS.

JavaScript.

Our web-app can serve the following functionalities:-

Select Algorithm of choice, mainly Breadth-First-Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm.


Select speed of animation


For more info about the project, the user can visit the InfoModal tab.


Afte the algorithm and the speed of the animation is selected we can then put walls (black-coloured squares) by our choice and specifiy the blockages in the traversed path.

After that the user can click the Start button and the visualization of the algorithm starts.



After the whole process has been completed, for a re-use you can click on the clear-board button.

We intend to improve it further and bring in more algorithms like A* and JumpFirstSearch .
